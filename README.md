### Limitations: 
none

### Lessons Learned:   

- plan more time for things you don't really know how to do
- youtube tutorials are your friend
- don't make a concept for a game you can't do just because it sounds cool in your head, after you have finished you can always add more things
- the 2D Debug Mode makes me aggressive
